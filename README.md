# Pursuit-for-Klue
A game I made in Love2d in a weekend for the kenney jam

Pursuit for Klue is a top down RPG where you go and Explore the world looking for Klue a lobster in a Action RPG style combat system you ask npcs and kill monsters to look for the clues to find Klue!

Press X to start game

WASD for controls 

space to attack

# NOTE:

If there arnt any items in the room where the monsters are that means you have to kill all of them

# how to navigate:

when it says the cords for example (1 1) that means North/South   East/West and when you go up it increases the North/South and when you go down its subtracts it and when you go left it subtracts East/west and when you go right you increase it by +1

How to fight: get close to the enemy but don't touch them then press space plus one of the WASD keys to go attack in that direction
